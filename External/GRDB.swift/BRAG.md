> I cannot recommend GRDB enough. It works well with Swift and eliminates whole classes of potential programming errors that can be made with Core Data. Also being able to use raw SQL queries if needed can be extremely useful!

> GRDB keeps being the best-in-class interface to your database, and if you're not using it you're missing out. As always, amazing work from  @groue !

> I’ve been working on a side project recently that uses SwiftUI (+UIKit for parent controllers and nav), Combine, GRDB, and GRDBCombine for automatic updating based on DB changes. I’m really liking this setup.
