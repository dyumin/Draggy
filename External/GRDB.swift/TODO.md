## Cleanup

- [ ] SQLCipher: sqlite3_rekey is discouraged (https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/issues/547#issuecomment-259219320)
- [ ] Write regression tests for #156 and #157
- [ ] deprecate ScopeAdapter(base, scopes), because base.addingScopes has a better implementation
- [ ] https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/514
- [ ] Test NOT TESTED methods
- [ ] Get inspiration from the templates at https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/tree/develop/.github (https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/3523)

## Documentation

- [ ] Enhance the introduction to SQLRequest, based on the feedback in https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/617
- [ ] Association: document how to use aggregates with inner join (testAnnotatedWithHasManyDefaultMaxJoiningRequired)


## Features

- [ ] GRDB 6: decoding errors
- [ ] GRDB 6: conflict resolution in persistence methods
- [ ] Long run edition. Use case: user edits the database (CRUD) but the application wants to commmit and the end of the editing session.
    * Create an edition SQLite connection with an open transaction (a new kind of DatabaseWriter with a save() method)
    * All other writes will fail with SQLITE_BUSY. Unless they are schedules in a target dispatch queue which is paused during the edition.
- [ ] Can we use generated columns to makes it convenient to index on inserted JSON objects? https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/3090#issuecomment-740091760
- [ ] DatabaseMigrator.publisher(in:)
- [ ] Look at [@FetchRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/fetchrequest): managed object context is stored in the environment, and error processing happens somewhere else (where?).
- [ ] Handle SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER in deleteAll(_:keys:) and similar APIs. https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html
- [ ] Concurrent migrator / or not
- [ ] Subqueries: request.isEmpty / request.exists
- [ ] Subqueries: request.count
- [ ] Extract one row from a hasMany association (the one with the maximum date, the one with a flag set, etc.) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43188771/sqlite-join-query-most-recent-posts-by-each-user (failed PR: https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/pull/767)
- [ ] Turn a hasMany to hasOne without first/last : hasMany(Book.self).filter(Column("isBest") /* assume a single book is flagged best */).asOne()
- [ ] Support for more kinds of joins: https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/740
- [ ] HasAndBelongsToMany: https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/711
- [ ] Support UNION https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/671
- [ ] Support Subqueries: WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ...)
- [ ] request.exists(db) as an alternative to fetchOne(db) != nil. Can generate optimized SQL.
- [ ] Measure the duration of transactions 
- [ ] Improve SQL generation for `Player.....fetchCount(db)`, especially with distinct. Try to avoid `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT player.* ...)`
- [ ] Alternative technique for custom SQLite builds: see the Podfile at https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/9104, and https://github.com/clemensg/sqlite3pod
- [ ] Attach databases. Interesting question: what happens when one attaches a non-WAL db to a databasePool?
- [ ] SQL Generation
    - [ ] date functions
    - [ ] NOW/CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    - [ ] ROUND() http://marc.info/?l=sqlite-users&m=130419182719263
    - [ ] RANDOM() https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html
    - [ ] GLOB https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] REGEXP https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] CASE x WHEN w1 THEN r1 WHEN w2 THEN r2 ELSE r3 END https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
- [ ] Allow concurrent reads from a snapshot
- [ ] Decode NSDecimalNumber from text database values
- [ ] Check https://sqlite.org/sqlar.html
- [ ] FTS: prefix queries
- [ ] More schema alterations
- [ ] DatabasePool.databaseSchemaIsLocked = true (should forbid schema changes, and never reset dbPool readers' caches). Or can we invalidate reader's cache automatically from the writer connection?
- [ ] Database.clearSchemaCache() is fine, but what about dbPool readers? Can we invalidate the cache for a whole pool?


## Unsure if necessary

- [ ] Have TableAlias embed the record type
- [ ] Have SQLPrimaryKeyExpression embed the record type
- [ ] Remove support for suspended databases - https://inessential.com/2020/02/13/how_we_fixed_the_dreaded_0xdead10cc_cras
- [ ] https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_index_xinfo
- [ ] Deprecate DatabaseQueue/Pool.addFunction, collation, tokenizer: those should be done in Configuration.prepareDatabase
- [ ] filter(rowid:), filter(rowids:)
- [ ] https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0075-import-test.md
- [ ] https://forums.swift.org/t/how-to-encode-objects-of-unknown-type/12253/6
- [ ] Configuration.crashOnError = true
- [ ] Glossary (Database Access Methods, etc.)
- [ ] Not sure: type safety for SQL expressions
    - [ ] Introduce some record protocol with an associated primary key type. Restrict filter(key:) methods to this type. Allow distinguishing FooId from BarId types.
    - [ ] Replace Column with TypedColumn. How to avoid code duplication (repeated types)? Keypaths?
- [ ] Cursor.underestimatedCount, which could speed up Array(cursor) and fetchAll()
- [ ] Remove prefix from association keys when association name is namespaced: https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/584#issuecomment-517658122
- [ ] Alternative support for custom SQLite builds, wih CocoaPods: https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/9103


## Unsure how

- [ ] Association limits: `Author.including(optional: Author.books.order(date.desc).first)`
- [ ] Joins and full-text tables
- [ ] UPSERT https://www.sqlite.org/lang_UPSERT.html
- [ ] Support for "INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...".
- [ ] Look at the jazzy configuration of https://github.com/bignerdranch/Deferred
- [ ] Predicates, so that a filter can be evaluated both on the database, and on a record instance.
    
    After investigation, we can't do it reliably without knowing the collation used by a column. And SQLite does not provide this information elsewhere than in the full CREATE TABLE statement stored in sqlite_master.
- [ ] ValueObservation erasure

    ```
    // Do better than this
    observation.mapReducer { _, reducer in AnyValueReducer(reducer) }
    ```
    
- [ ] new.updateChanges(from: old) vs. old.updateChanges(with: { old.a = new.a }). This is confusing.
