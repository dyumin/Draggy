When updating:
- Merge the file/ subdirectory.
	- file/magic/Magdir/c-lang needs to say "c program text" for conformance
	- Beware updating file/magic/Magdir/mach since many internal systems rely on the current output of file.
	- file/magic/Magdir/msdos is also sensitive for internal processes, since this defines EFI file types as well.

- Run configure & make in the upstream sources
	- Merge config.h and file/src/magic.h changes.  In particular, version numbers and any new options or api introduced in the new version.
